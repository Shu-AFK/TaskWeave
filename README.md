# TaskWeave

Welcome to TaskWeave, a simple yet powerful workload balancer **(Work in progress)** that I've designed to help single users
(and in the future maybe teams) efficiently manage their daily tasks.

## Features **(Work in progress)**

* **Workload Balancing:** TaskWeave helps you distribute your work evenly across your day.
* **Prioritization:** Assign priorities according to your tasks' urgency and importance.
* **Task Tracking:** Helps you stay on track with all tasks, avoiding missing due dates.

## Installation

Please make sure you have Go installed on your system first.

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Shu-AFK/taskweave.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the `taskweave` directory:
   ```
   cd taskweave
   ```

3. Build the application:
   ``` 
   go build -o ./cmd/taskweave ./cmd/taskweave
   ```

4. Now, run the application with:
   ```
   ./taskweave
   ```

## Usage

Once you've started the application, you can immediately start adding and balancing tasks.
**(More about that in the future)**
